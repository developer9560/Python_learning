print(10//3) # yields 3
print(-10//3) # yields -4 (in -10 //3 , multiple of 3 which will yield -10 is  -3.333, whose floor value is -4)
print(10//-3) # yiels -4 (in 10//-3 , multiple of -3 which will yield 10 is -3.3333, whose floor value is -4 )
print(-10//-3) # yields 3 
print(3//10) # yields 0
print(3//-10) # yeild -1 
print(-3//10) # yeilds -1
print(-3//-10) # yeilds 0 

# operation a%b is evaluated as a-(b*(a//b)). This can be best understood using the follwoing examples:

print(10%3) 
print(-10%3)
print(10% -3)
print(-10 % -3)
print(3%10)
print(3%10)
print(-3%10)
print(-3%-10)
